# Fleet Audit

Three modes, one skill. The user's question determines which mode to run.

## Mode: health

**Trigger:** "Is the fleet healthy?", "check all projects", "what's broken?", "can I deploy everything?"

Updates safe repositories, then checks git state, CI signal, and branch status
across the fleet workspace plus active projects listed in
`~/Desktop/fleet/README.md`.

```bash
bash ~/Desktop/fleet/foundry/ops/scripts/fleet-health.sh
bash ~/Desktop/fleet/foundry/ops/scripts/fleet-health.sh --no-fetch     # skip git fetch and pull
bash ~/Desktop/fleet/foundry/ops/scripts/fleet-health.sh --only saas-maker,aliveville
```

The script reads the project list from the fleet README, so it stays in sync
automatically, and includes the fleet workspace repository itself. By default
it fetches each repository and fast-forward-pulls a behind branch only when the
worktree is clean, the branch has an upstream, and there are no local-only
commits. Dirty, detached, ahead, and diverged repositories are left untouched
and reported. For each repository it then checks:

1. **Update** — safely pulled, already current, or intentionally skipped?
2. **Git state** — clean? dirty?
3. **Branch** — on main?
4. **Remote sync** — ahead/behind?
5. **CI signal** — latest GitHub Actions run on main

Output a compact table:

```
PROJECT          BRANCH  GIT    CI     NOTES
saas-maker       main    clean  green  —
aliveville       main    dirty  green  2 uncommitted files
anime-list       main    clean  red    ci.yml failing
```

Summary: N clean, N dirty, N CI-red, N unknown.

**Act on results:**
- CI-red → investigate the failing workflow, fix or track
- Dirty → commit or stash before fleet operations
- Not on main → flag if deploy planned

## Mode: status

**Trigger:** "What's the fleet status?", "what's everyone working on?", "what shipped recently?", "what's blocked?"

Reads each project's `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for durable current/shipped truth and
GitHub Issues/pull requests for operational state. `STATUS.md` is legacy and
must not be treated as a second queue.

```bash
# Product truth
head -40 PROJECT_STATUS.md

# Operational truth
gh issue list --state open
gh pr list --state open
```

Canonical product domains live in `foundry/ops/config/projects.json` under each
project's `domains` array — do NOT infer domains from status file prose. Load
them once and join by project id when reporting live URLs:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('foundry/ops/config/projects.json')); \
print({p['id']: p.get('domains', []) for p in d['projects']})"
```

For each project extract:

- **Last updated** date
- **Thesis** (one line)
- **Latest timeline entry** (most recent ship)
- **Active scope** (what's IN scope)
- **Open issues** (to-do)
- **Open issues with linked PRs** (in progress)
- **Issues labelled `blocked`** (blocked)
- **Live domain(s)** from `projects.json` (not from prose)

Output:

```
## Fleet Status — YYYY-MM-DD

### Recently shipped (last 7 days)
- project-name: what shipped

### Active work
- project-name: current focus

### Blocked / deferred
- project-name: what's blocked and why

### Stale (status file not updated in 30+ days)
- project-name: last updated YYYY-MM-DD
```

Don't fabricate status — if `PROJECT_STATUS.md` is absent or GitHub state is
unavailable, report that explicitly. This is read-only; it doesn't modify any
files.

## Mode: full

**Trigger:** "Audit the fleet", "run the fleet audit", "prepare a fleet report", "triage fleet regressions"

Runs the Fleet-owned audit stack from the Fleet root:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/fleet
./foundry/ops/scripts/git-health.sh --all --no-fetch
./foundry/ops/scripts/deploy-health.sh
node foundry/ops/scripts/cloudflare-resilience-audit.mjs
```

Writes to:
- `.symphony/cloudflare-resilience/latest.md`
- `.symphony/cloudflare-resilience/latest.json`

Variations:

```bash
node foundry/ops/scripts/cloudflare-resilience-audit.mjs --no-live
node foundry/ops/scripts/site-health-scorecard.mjs --all
bash foundry/ops/scripts/fleet-perf-weekly.sh --runs 3 --concurrency 2
```

### How to interpret

- `ok`: no open PRs, failed workflows, failed smoke checks, dirty state, or check failures.
- `watch`: open PRs or perf budget warnings; don't create urgent tasks unless stale or regressed.
- `fail`: real regression candidate; read details before creating tasks.

Expected non-issues:
- `mal-api...workers.dev/` root may be `404`.
- First-run perf budget warnings are baselines, not regressions.

### GitHub Actions evidence rules

Treat workflow state as versioned project configuration, not an append-only
history of equally relevant runs:

1. Only workflows that still exist on the remote default branch contribute to
   current CI health. Ignore the final run of a deleted workflow.
2. A failed latest run at the current `origin/main` SHA is a `fail`.
3. A failed latest run only on an older SHA is a `watch`; inspect whether the
   workflow or failing code changed before creating a task.
4. Distinguish product CI, deploy, scheduled data pipelines, and maintenance
   automation. A failed bot PR or optional data refresh is not automatically a
   broken user-facing product.
5. Explicitly retired or local-only projects do not need Actions or a deploy
   script. Static Git-connected Pages sites may have only a lightweight content
   check; do not infer that a deleted manual deploy workflow is missing.
6. Unpublished local workflow edits do not change remote health. Report the
   remote failure until the change is committed and pushed.

When aggregate output is red, open the failing job and identify the exact
failed step before assigning severity.

### Workflow

1. Run the Fleet-owned audit stack unless the user asks for a quick pass.
2. Read `.symphony/cloudflare-resilience/latest.md`.
3. Summarize: open PRs, failed workflows, failed smoke checks, local failures, perf issues, dirty repos.
4. Record real regressions in the owning repository's GitHub Issues.
5. Do not auto-merge, deploy, delete Cloudflare projects, rotate secrets, or clean worktrees unless explicitly asked.

### Follow-up rules

Record follow-up for:
- latest main workflow failures
- failed production smoke checks
- local build/test/typecheck failures
- broken deploy pipeline

Do not create tasks for:
- known open PRs unless stale or blocking
- expected API-root 404s
- local dirty state in saas-maker during active work
- missing local OAuth credentials when builds pass

## Output style (all modes)

Keep reports compact:
- lead with overall status
- list real regressions first
- list watch items separately
- include links for PRs/actions when available
- include the report path (for full mode)
