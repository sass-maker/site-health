# Video agent operation contract

All Fleet video products accept one JSON request and emit one JSON result using
`fleet.video-agent-operation.v1`. The CLI is the canonical transport; MCP or
other agent tools must remain thin adapters over the same product service.

Lifecycle ownership is intentionally split:

- Studio plans, validates, edits, estimates, renders, selects, and exports one source video.
- Mashup ingests creator-owned archives and produces approved editorial media receipts.
- Reel Pipeline executes registered video recipes, packages finished media, and is the only product allowed to publish through configured channels.

No request accepts shell commands, source code, executable paths, or arbitrary
plugins. Publication additionally requires a channel entry whose mode is
`draft_only`, `approval_required`, or `autonomous`.

Discover live capabilities before operating a product:

```sh
npm run agent -- --request request.json          # Reel Pipeline
uv run mashup agent --request request.json       # Mashup
swift run studio-agent --request request.json    # Local Video Studio
```

`manifest` is always read-only. Use `validateOnly: true` before render, write,
or external operations. A completed envelope includes a normalized request
hash and artifact paths; failures contain a stable error code and never execute
an unknown capability.
