// IMPORTANT: Markdown under `docs/` is the source of truth. Blume is only the
// presentation + search layer. Generated output goes to `docs-dist/` (git-
// ignored) — never edit files there; edit the Markdown and re-run
// `pnpm docs:build`.
//
// `github` is intentionally omitted: this package lives at
// `fleet-ops/psi-swarm/` inside the `sass-maker/fleet-workspace` monorepo, so
// Blume's auto "Edit on GitHub" link (which resolves from the content root)
// would point at the wrong path. Add `github` here only if the docs are
// split into their own repo.
