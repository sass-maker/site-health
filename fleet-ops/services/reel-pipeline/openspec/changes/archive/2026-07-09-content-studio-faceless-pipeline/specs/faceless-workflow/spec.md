# faceless-workflow

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Topic to rendered video in one command
The workflow SHALL take a topic (plus optional niche, duration, voice, and
brand-voice profile) and produce: a script, a VideoBrief, and a rendered MP4
via an existing render adapter, writing artifacts under an output directory.
The default adapter for real renders SHALL be MoneyPrinterTurbo; `mock` SHALL
be available for smoke runs. `render-pro.js` remains the canonical production
renderer and is not modified.

#### Scenario: Mock end-to-end
- **WHEN** the workflow runs with `--engine mock` for a topic
- **THEN** it writes script.json, brief.json, and a rendered artifact, and exits 0

#### Scenario: Duration honored
- **WHEN** the user passes a target duration
- **THEN** the generated brief's scene durations sum to the target ± 10%

### Requirement: Single-voice default
Generated briefs SHALL use one narration voice for the entire video by
default; per-scene voice rotation SHALL require an explicit opt-in flag.

#### Scenario: Default voicing
- **WHEN** the workflow generates a brief without a rotation flag
- **THEN** every scene uses the same voice id

### Requirement: Batch production
The workflow SHALL accept a topics file (one topic per line or JSON array) and
process each topic sequentially, isolating failures per topic and writing a
batch summary (succeeded/failed per topic).

#### Scenario: Batch with one failure
- **WHEN** a batch of 3 topics runs and one topic's render fails
- **THEN** the other 2 complete and the summary records 2 succeeded / 1 failed

### Requirement: Posting handoff
The workflow SHALL optionally hand a rendered video to the existing posting
path by saving the idea/draft with rendered status and printing the exact
existing post command; it SHALL NOT post automatically without the explicit
flag used by the existing Rust posting layer.

#### Scenario: Handoff without auto-post
- **WHEN** a workflow render completes without a post flag
- **THEN** no posting API is called and the summary includes the manual post command
