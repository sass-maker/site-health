# Reel Pipeline

AI reel generation and autopost orchestration for fleet products. Turns
approved SaaS Maker marketing ideas, High Signal briefs, Significant Hobbies
envelopes, and public brand URLs into reviewable short-form video drafts,
rendered MP4s, and gated posting handoff.

The public product does one thing: paste a public HTTPS brand website and get
a presenter-led vertical reel. There is no login, account, billing,
workspace, actor onboarding, or social connection in that flow. The older
review, studio, and fleet marketing utilities are internal tooling; they are
not visitor product surfaces and do not add identity to the anonymous
brand-reel path.

## Start here

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — agent bootloader: essential commands, critical
  constraints, documentation navigation.
- [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) — short executive view (objective, what works,
  blockers, next steps).
- [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](PROJECT_STATUS.md) — detailed status, dependencies,
  timeline, features shipped, todo/deferred/blocked.
- [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) — full documentation navigation hub.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>      # engines/* are submodules
npm ci                                          # Node ≥ 20; Rust stable for reel/
npm run dev                                     # local control API on http://127.0.0.1:4317
# root page  → anonymous brand URL → presenter-led reel
# /review    → swipe approve/reject UI
# /studio    → content studio
```

Verify:

```bash
npm test                  # node --test + cargo test
npm run smoke:mock        # no-dependency end-to-end smoke
npm run ready:local       # top-level generation-cases readiness
```

| Artifact Worker | Browsers / integrators | `https://reel-pipeline-artifacts.sarthakagrawal927.workers.dev` |

The Worker's health check and rendered artifacts are public. Its review UI,
draft listing, draft creation, approval, and render-trigger routes require the
secret-backed `REEL_INTERNAL_TOKEN`; browser access uses HTTP Basic user
`foundry`, while scripts and the Rust watcher send the same token as Bearer
authentication. The separate anonymous brand-reel flow remains unauthenticated.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

Two non-overlapping flows. **Worker reel flow** (production render path):
Cloudflare Worker + R2 → Rust watcher → `node scripts/render-pro.js`
(Chrome CDP + Edge TTS + ffmpeg + R2 upload + worker patch). **Marketing
autopilot flow**: SaaS Maker queue → hold-window auto-accept → render
accepted posts via `VideoBrief` contract → R2 artifact → gated post to
YouTube / Instagram. Default render mode is `mock`; local no-credential
modes (`mock`, `html-composition`, `ascii`, `grok-video`, `reel-maker`,
`kokoro`, `brand-video`) are proven by `npm run smoke:render-modes`. Full
architecture: [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md).
Engines: [`docs/architecture/engines.md`](docs/architecture/engines.md).
Render modes: [`docs/architecture/render-modes.md`](docs/architecture/render-modes.md).

## Language note

GitHub shows this repo as JavaScript because the code in this repo is a small
Node.js / Cloudflare Workers orchestration layer. The Rust orchestrator
(`reel/`) owns watch, render-accepted, autopilot, and post entrypoints; JS
remains for `render-pro.js`, OAuth bootstrap, and the local dev server. See
[`docs/architecture/rust-orchestrator.md`](docs/architecture/rust-orchestrator.md)
and
[`docs/architecture/decisions/0001-rust-orchestrator-cutover.md`](docs/architecture/decisions/0001-rust-orchestrator-cutover.md).

## Practical caveat

The pipeline is technically working. The generated videos are still
low-quality until creative direction, footage selection, UGC actor support,
and post-render review improve. Treat the current release as infrastructure
and draft production, not final marketing quality.

## Update policy

- Markdown under `docs/` (plus root `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`,
  `PROJECT_STATUS.md`) is the source of truth. Blume only renders it.
- One canonical home per fact. Link, do not restate.
- Code/config (`package.json`, `config/*.json`, `wrangler.jsonc`, CI) is
  authoritative for implementation details and schedules.
- Use `git mv` when reorganizing docs. Prefer `docs/archive/` over deletion.
- Run `npm run docs:validate` before committing doc changes; CI enforces it.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full documentation maintenance rules.
